👋 Welcome to the Crypto Character, where all of us can own a unique character with customizable styles! The contract uses IPFS to store the style images of the character and allows the owner to add more styles to the hair, eyes, cloth, and mouth.

## ✍️ How it works
There will be only one character in this contract, and if a user wants to change the hairstyle, eyes, cloth, or mouth of the character, they must pay a larger amount than the highest bid of the previous bidder. Once the payment is made, the user gains ownership of that part of the character, and the character's style is updated to the new style selected by the user.

The ownership of the part of the character can be transferred to a new owner if another user pays a larger amount than the current owner.

## 🍬 Contract details
The Crypto Character Contract is written in both Solidity, Solidity inline assembly, and pure Yul for learning purposes.

## ✍️ Conclusion
The Crypto Character Contract is a fun and innovative way to own a unique character with customizable styles. The contract is secure, transparent, and decentralized, ensuring that the ownership and styles of the character remain in the hands of the most passionate users.
